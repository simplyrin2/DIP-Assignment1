## Additional Topics
In addition to the concepts and techniques mentioned above, this assignment also covers the following topics:

### Histogram Computation
Learn how to compute histograms of digital images, which provide valuable insights into the distribution of pixel intensities.

### Otsu's Binarization
Discover Otsu's method for automatic image thresholding, which optimally separates foreground and background pixels based on the image's histogram.

### Adaptive Binarization
Explore adaptive binarization techniques, where the threshold for each pixel is dynamically determined based on its local neighborhood.

### Connected Components
Learn how to identify and label connected regions in an image, which is useful for tasks such as object detection and segmentation.

By studying these additional topics, you will further enhance your understanding of digital image processing and its practical applications.
